                               .:: Readme ::.

Some restrictions:

1) Its only work for once message.
After it, you need empty you 
"%%appdata%%/skype/<skypename>"
directory or use another credentials.
Worked with latest 3.8 and 4.2(?)

2) You need to know port on which skype is listening
and skypename which active on this.
Format is:
skypename:skypeIP:skypePORT
Example:
kolomblog:192.168.1.75:57608

3) 
For restore and getting you credentials 
you need login first with skype with "save password" option,
Also known as "Sign me in when skype starts".



Thats all.

Thanks to dose for amazing work on skydumpcred.
